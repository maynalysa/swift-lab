A growing lab of Swift and SwiftUI experiments, patterns, and reusable components I’m building and sharing along my app development journey. 
This is both a personal reference and a resource for fellow developers looking for clean, reusable Swift/SwiftUI examples.

---

## ✨ Why this repo?

As I build real-world apps using **SwiftUI + Clean Architecture + VIPER**, I often create small, focused examples that solve specific UI or architectural needs.
Instead of letting them get lost in various projects, I decided to gather them here — organized, documented, and ready to reuse.

---

## 🔬 What you’ll find

- 💡 UI animations (e.g. floating, neon glow, shimmer, etc.)
- ⚙️ Architecture-ready utilities and design patterns
- 🧱 Reusable SwiftUI components (buttons, loaders, cards, etc.)
- 📐 Layout tricks and interaction patterns
- 🧪 Code experiments with Swift and Apple frameworks

Everything is:
- ✅ 100% native Swift / SwiftUI
- ♻️ Reusable and modular
- 🧠 Easy to plug into real projects

## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Development

Several components and code patterns in this repo were built and refined in minutes using **Claude 3.7** and **ChatGPT 4**.

> I use AI tools to:
> - Brainstorm ideas and UI variations
> - Speed up syntax scaffolding
> - Refactor or simplify logic
> - Get instant feedback on SwiftUI layouts

AI has been a huge boost in turning ideas into polished, reusable code faster than ever.

## 🗂 Examples So Far

- FloatingAnimation – A smooth floating animation for any View
- NoenEffectAnimation – A smooth neon animation for either a Text or an Image
*(More coming soon – this repo grows as I build.)*

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Keep every snippet **self-contained** and **easy to understand**
- Follow **SwiftUI best practices** (declarative, composable, testable)
- Apply **Clean Architecture principles** where relevant (VIPER, DI, etc.)
- Empower others to build faster and better with SwiftUI

---

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swiftui-exemples.git
2. Open SwiftUI-Exemples.xcodeproj
3. Browse and run any file using the canvas preview or the simulator
