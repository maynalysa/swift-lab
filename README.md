# 📱 siwft-swiftui-examples

A curated collection of SwiftUI code snippets and UI patterns I’m building and sharing along my app development journey.  
This is both a personal reference and a resource for fellow developers looking for clean, reusable SwiftUI examples.

---

## ✨ Why this repo?

As I build real-world apps using **SwiftUI + Clean Architecture + VIPER**, I often create small, focused examples that solve specific UI or architectural needs. Instead of letting them get lost in various projects, I decided to gather them here — organized, documented, and ready to reuse.

---

## 📦 What's inside?

Each folder contains:
- ✅ A SwiftUI view or feature (component, animation, transition, etc.)
- 🔍 A minimal preview for quick testing
- 🧠 Comments & insights about usage or trade-offs

---

## 🗂 Examples So Far

//- `FloatingAnimationView` – A smooth floating animation for icons or buttons

*(More coming soon – this repo grows as I build.)*

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Keep every snippet **self-contained** and **easy to understand**
- Follow **SwiftUI best practices** (declarative, composable, testable)
- Apply **Clean Architecture principles** where relevant (VIPER, DI, etc.)
- Empower others to build faster and better with SwiftUI

---

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swiftui-exemples.git
2. Open SwiftUI-Exemples.xcodeproj
3. Browse and run any file using the canvas preview or the simulator
